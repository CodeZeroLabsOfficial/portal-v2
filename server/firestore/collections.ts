/**
 * Firestore collection names — single source of truth for paths and query helpers.
 *
 * Security rules (high level — implement in Firebase console):
 * - `users`: user can read/write own doc; admins can read org members via custom claims or backend checks.
 * - `users/{uid}/subscriptions`, `users/{uid}/invoices`, `users/{uid}/payments`, `users/{uid}/paymentMethods`: portal billing mirrors (webhooks / functions).
 * - Top-level `subscriptions`, `invoices`, `payments`: org-scoped staff views and legacy customerId-indexed mirrors.
 * - `opportunities`: staff-only reads/writes (Admin SDK in this app); add rules matching `customers` if exposed to clients.
 * - `proposals`, `proposal_templates`, `contract_templates`, `services`: org-scoped staff;
 *   public proposal flows use Admin SDK (not client reads). See `firestore.rules`.
 * - `tasks`: staff-only; mutations mostly Admin SDK (limited client status updates).
 * - `notifications`: staff inbox; recipient may read own docs; writes Admin SDK only.
 * - `analytics_events`: insert from authenticated viewer session or validated public token; reads restricted to proposal owners.
 * - `signedAgreements`: append-only snapshots when a proposal is accepted with a signature (Admin SDK).
